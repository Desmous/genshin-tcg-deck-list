description: This deck is based around utilising Fischl's skill and Collei's burst to output massive damage with the above-average 3 damage reaction, Quicken. The goal of the deck is to pressure the opponent from game start to game end, making sure they cannot execute their game plans peacefully. In addition, Dendro Resonance serves to counter the popular card, Xingqiu.

## Mulligan
<CardRow :cards="['The Bestest Travel Companion', 'Liben', 'Liu Su', 'Liyue Harbor Wharf', 'Chang the Ninth']"></CardRow>

For your mulligan, first look for cards that can patch up bad dice in some way, such as The Bestest Travel Companion!, Liben, or even Paimon. This is because not being able to use your Elemental Skills significantly hinders a deck like Chicken Quicken, which relies heavily on getting Elemental Auras out early.  <br></br>

Next, search for cards that take time to activate. For example, Liyue Harbour Wharf, Paimon, and Chang the Ninth are all very strong cards, but require being played as early as possible to get the best value out of them.  <br></br>

An exception to this mulligan would be Xingqiu decks. Against them, Elemental Resonance: Sprawling Greenery is a must-have. Xingqiu decks will always give you a free Bloom reaction due to the nature of Xingqiu's kit, and Elemental Resonance: Sprawling Greenery can duplicate the Bloom seeds you get. This transforms the card to 1-cost for a total of 4 damage, which is incredibly high value, and can be game-winning just by itself.  <br></br>

Finally, be sure not to auto-pilot the mulligan. The game gives the player a significant amount of time in the mulligan phase. Do not just squander this time away, and use it to plan out your turns at least 2-3 rounds in advance. I'll give an example. Against a Xingqiu deck, Collei skill, Paimon, and Liyue Harbour Wharf is a very strong opener. However, if you try the same thing towards a deck with early kill pressure (such as another Quicken deck), you will likely end up losing your Collei or Fischl before they can do much of anything. You also need to keep in mind the dice you might need to pull off certain plays. Keep Changing Shifts and Elemental Resonance: Woven Weeds if you have a Liyue Harbour Wharf in your hand, as it allows for you to Elemental Skill on both Fischl and Collei and still get your Liyue Harbour Wharf off.

## Early Game Plan
I will now elaborate on your gameplans in the early rounds. In essence, there are two main lines of play for this deck. The Xingqiu opener and the general opener.  <br></br>

First, I will explain the general opener. Open the game with a Fischl skill. From here, you look to do one of two things. Option 1 is to play all support cards and end your turn, while Option 2 is to swap to Collei. Go with Option 1 if you're up against a deck that is unable to punish such a play. For example, it's fine to do this against a Ganyu Fischl Keqing deck, that will not gain much from you not swapping off. If Option 1 is not avaliable in your game, you can proceed to Option 2. Option 2 will require you to have either a 1-cost card (ideally Liu Su) with 3 Dendro Dice/a 3-cost card, or two 2-cost cards. After swapping to Collei, you look to trigger the Quicken reaction if possible. If you are unable to do so, don't fret, and just end your turn after playing some support cards.  <br></br>

Next, the Xingqiu Opener. Start the game with a Collei skill. From here, look to either build up your Collei burst or play support cards and end your turn. Xingqiu decks cannot punish you for a support cards start, so I would look to abuse that. An interesting line you can do if you happen to start first is Collei Skill > Collei NA/Skill > End Turn > Round 2 Adeptus Burst. The idea of this is a guaranteed Xingqiu kill round 2 if they do not Xingqiu skill with adeptus, instantly winning you the game. 

 
## Mid-Late Game Plan
Your gameplan in Round 2 is very simple. No matter what you did in Round 1, look to get your Collei burst off as soon as possible. What you do after depends on the game. As Fischl skill lasts for 2 rounds, you can generally just play support cards and end turn if you started Fischl, but with a Collei start, you would look to get your Fischl skill going now.  <br></br>

Round 3 onwards is mostly freestyle. At this point in the game, you ideally should have accumulated a massive hand and dice advantage from all the support cards you played previously. Using this, you can typically close out a game in a variety of ways. Typically, it's either a Fischl burst or a Jadeplume Terrorshroom burst.

## General Gameplay Tips
Elemental Resonance: Sprawling Greenery works as such: After playing the card, your next Elemental Reaction (does NOT have to be Dendro!) will deal an additional 2 damage, and any Catalyzing Field or Dendro Core stacks you have AT LEAST 1 stack of will get a Quick Knit effect, adding +1 to their usages. If you do not have any Catalyzing Field charges prior to using this card, but end up using the +2 damage on a Quicken, you will not get +3 stacks instead of +2 stacks! You need to use it with already pre-existing stacks to take advantage of that effect. In addition, this card works with any summons you may have. As such, one play I like to do with this deck is using Elemental Resonance: Sprawling Greenery with 1 Catalyzing Field usage, no aura on the opposing character, and both Collei and Fischl summons up, making full usage of the damage boost and the usage addition.  <br></br>

It's perfectly fine to use Normal Attacks if you already have an aura applied and don't have the dice for it. Not using Elemental Skills all the time is really important, because it makes your deck significantly less vulnerable to bad dice rolls.  <br></br>

Only ever swap to Jadeplume Terrorshroom if you're sure you can either get its burst off this round or that it will not hit 3 stacks this round. Remember that Normal Attacks do not add to Jadeplume Terrorshroom's Radical Vitality stacks! In addition, summons can also add to Jadeplume Terrorshroom's stacks. However, due to a techicality in how End Phase effects trigger, if you end your round first, your Jadeplume Terrorshroom will never get his energy reset by summons. End Phase effects trigger based on who ended their round first. As Jadeplume Terrorshroom will count its own stacks before the enemy summons hit it, you can abuse this trick to start the round with 3 stacks for free.  <br></br>

As this deck has a lot of draw, you may find yourself overdrawing when you first start out. To prevent this, constantly keep track of how much you're drawing, and make sure you always have hand space. If you have a hand full of draw, you can use and tune support cards freely, without having to wait for the most optimal play like you would with a normal deck.  <br></br>

Elemental Skills are powerful, but they're not always the best play. For example, if you can finish off a character with just your Normal Attack, that would likely be the best play, as you save on Aligned Dice and Catalyzing Field usages. In addition, if you don't have enough Aligned Dice, you can typically Normal Attack if you already have the active character's Elemental Aura on the opposing character. You just have to be sure it doesn't cause you to miss 1 damage on a kill later down the line.
